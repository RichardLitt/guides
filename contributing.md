#Pull Requests:

 * Pull requests are always welcome.
 * We prioritize PRs over issues.
 * Please poke us if a PR goes ignored. We're busy, and we want to see your PR merged, but sometimes other things come up. If you feel like we've forgotten about your PR, either leave a comment on the PR or contact one of us directly.
 * If possible add tests. If the package does not yet have a test suite, you're welcome to set one up, but please ask us first before choosing a test runner. Open an issue to start the discussion.
 * If changes are considerable, it is recommended to open an issue and start a discussion first, otherwise we may ask for considerable revisions before accepting.
 * In general, we want packages to do one thing really well, and make other things easier for other people. If we feel that a PR spreads the focus of a package too far, we will likely not accept it. You are always welcome to fork or create your own package.
 * If your PR changes the package's installation instructions, public API, or changes expected behaviour, please also update the corresponding documentation (usually README.md).
 * Do not change the version number in package.js as we may not merge PRs in the same order that they are submitted.
