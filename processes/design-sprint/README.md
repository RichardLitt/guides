### Prepare for the Sprint (Package we send out)
---
Congratulations! You are on your way to running a successful Sprint!

##### Rules
* Everyone participates
* One conversation at a time
* Withhold judgement
* Get up and draw
* Be Comfortable - clothing, relaxed, room
* Easy on people, tough on ideas
* On time, be present
* No phones!
* No jargon
* No “yes, but”
* No HiPPO (Highest paid person in the Office)
* No part-time participants
* Testing the Idea, not the design

##### Focus on the Journey
We aren’t building a full mockup, we are validating (or invalidating) an idea. Reiterate this every day.

##### Materials
* Markers
* Full-Poster sticky paper
* Dot stickers
* Small and Medium sized post-its

### Before the Sprint (Week before)
---
Do some internal “Understanding" before Day 1

##### Understand who will we be participating
* Get a list of participants, names, titles, responsibilities, etc.
* Which part of the product is each participant responsible for?

##### Send us all the information about your ideal customer before the kick off call.
* Target demographics
* Opinions they might have on their ideal demographics
    * This will help us (OK GROW!) ask questions to that demographic regarding the idea before Day 1 and form our own opinions

##### If sprint is on an existing product
* Links to their current product/app/website
* Any analytics on the current product
* Understand the product
    * What is the impact of the product on your existing business
    * What do you want the users to do with your app (success criteria)
    * Why doesn’t it currently work? What is it not accomplishing for your current users?

##### Hand pick exercises based on our learnings to get the best outcome
* Example: If it’s an existing app we are working on, we should include `User Journey Map` exercise.
* New product? More mind maps
* Difficulty detailing target demographic? More personas

##### Source Testers
* From the learnings we made, confirm a medium of where to source testers
* Confirm the number of testers
    
##### Tips on snacks and how to keep the energy up throughout the day:
* Share this guide with the client before Day 1
* The obvious one is reduce high carb, late lunches
* Stay hydrated
* Being very precise on when to take breaks. 
    * Make sure that everyone knows when breaks happen so everyone can focus on the sprint.

### Kick off call with the client (Day before)
---
* Introduce ourselves
* get pumped
* confirm the schedule
* confirm attendees
* Confirm room
* Quick rundown of what we are trying to do a.k.a testing an idea/outcome
* Quick review days 1-5 (goals for each day)

Split up into two groups. One group designs an interview, and the other creates a hi-fidelity prototype

##### Designing the Interview
- focus on testing navigational outcomes (quantitative)
  - define metrics of success
- focus on testing opinions and feelings (qualitative)

##### Generate mockup that was made at the end of day 3 should not be drastically changed.
2 meetings for feedback throughout the day?

##### Tools
Adobe XD or Sketch + Invision

### Testing (Day 5)
