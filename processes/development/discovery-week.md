### The goal

Our goal is to know what we’re getting into and to be able to give a good estimate at the end of the week. This should be “Week 0” of a development project.

We have two types of discovery weeks:

1. A new product to build
2. Consulting work on an existing product

It could potentially be a mix of the two.

For the first type the main work should be detailed user stories with scenarios in Cucumber format.

For the second type the main work should be getting the existing app running and understanding it in detail.

#### Before the week

- Clients should have already received the [Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#).
- Ensure that we have everything from the client that was listed in the [“Prerequisites” section of the Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#heading=h.2jz1on9cuw4)
- Set [project roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y0o2OXdrx2arENp4BoRtJQojqGGhbRky7CBDIdeggJY/edit#gid=0)
  - Project lead (developer or designer, team lead)
  - Team members (developers & designers)
  - Advisor (someone not on the team)
- Share the Google Drive folder with everyone on our team
- Schedule meetings
  - Kick-off call the week before (Wednesday or earlier) with the whole team invited to make sure everyone will be prepared
  - Monday morning meeting to go into more details
  - Final meeting for Friday as early as possible.
  - Daily status meeting, 15 minutes
- Client should have given us access to a repo and instructions to set up a dev environment
- Create Trello board
  - For consulting projects use: [https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6](https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6)
  - For feature/app development projects use: [https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG](https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG)
- Create Slack channel for ourselves
- Create project email alias (Google Group): &lt;project&gt;@okgrow.com
- Send the project email to the Slack channel:
  - In “Posting permissions” edit the “Post” setting  and allow public to post.
  - In "Basic permissions" check the checkbox for "Allow members external to this organization" then under "Join the group" select "Anyone can ask"
  - Add Slack email integration and add the email address to the Google Group (this needs to be done by someone with Google Apps admin access).
  - You may now go back to "Basic permissions" and uncheck the checkbox for "Allow members external to this organization" then under "Join the group" change it back to just "Anyone in the organization can ask"
- Create project info doc, copy from [template](https://docs.google.com/a/okgrow.com/document/d/1KUVInohhNZxmrlsJw7Ax5MMQraawglGpTo1O-eXJ030/edit) into project folder.

#### The deliverables

In both cases the most important goal for the week is a good estimate with confidence that we understand everything that’s needed.

What we give to them:

1. Estimate spreadsheet (share it comment-only, and wait until after reviewing it on a call).
2. Trello board:
  1. New product: user stories with detailed Cucumber scenarios
  2. Consulting work on an existing product: technical investigation and details of tasks and recommendations
3. Capture document summarizing the above
