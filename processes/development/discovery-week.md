### The goal

Our goal is to know what we’re getting into and to be able to give a good estimate at the end of the week. This should be “Week 0” of a development project.

We have two types of discovery weeks:

1. A new product to build
2. Consulting work on an existing product

It could potentially be a mix of the two.

For the first type the main work should be detailed user stories with scenarios in Cucumber format.

For the second type the main work should be getting the existing app running and understanding it in detail.

#### Before the week

- Clients should have already received the [Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#).
- Ensure that we have everything from the client that was listed in the [“Prerequisites” section of the Discovery Phase Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QbXCpRvtPcEJ-TbYPSbJXEJ5xFbS_vOIckGJAUTAV0/edit#heading=h.2jz1on9cuw4)
- Share the Google Drive folders with everyone on the team _Question/Clarification: everyone on the OK Grow! team?_
- Schedule a kick-off call for the week before (Wednesday or earlier) with the whole team invited to make sure everyone will be prepared
- Schedule a Monday morning meeting to go into more details
- Schedule a final meeting for Friday as early as possible.
- Schedule a daily status meeting, 15 minutes
- Client should have given us access to a repo, and that repo should have a readme that details how to setup a dev environment

#### At the beginning of the week

- Create Trello board
  - For consulting projects use: [https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6](https://trello.com/b/aih9u2u6)
  - For feature/app development projects use: [https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG](https://trello.com/b/lPS0CYbG)
- Share the project folder with the team _Question: Google drive folder was already shared in 'Before the week'_
- Create Slack channel for ourselves
- Set [project roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y0o2OXdrx2arENp4BoRtJQojqGGhbRky7CBDIdeggJY/edit#gid=0)
  - Project lead (developer or designer, team lead)
  - Team members (developers & designers)
  - Advisor (someone not on the team)
  _Question: Who sets these roles? Should this not be done in the 'Before the week' step?_
- Create project email alias: &lt;project&gt;@okgrow.com (a list that includes all developers on the project)
  - Edit “Post” setting in “Posting permissions” and allow public to post.
- Create and share project info doc, copy from [template](https://docs.google.com/a/okgrow.com/document/d/1KUVInohhNZxmrlsJw7Ax5MMQraawglGpTo1O-eXJ030/edit) into project folder. _Question: template is based on a full, running project. Trello board specifically references the working board, not Discovery board.  Should this be changed?_
- Send [client onboarding email](https://docs.google.com/a/okgrow.com/document/d/1T0jFzBXO7kRyBQxnaI3yuQi9Op1LdqI_yb_LPqXsNY4/edit)
- Construct a final doc at end of week as the main deliverable to the client.

#### The deliverables

In both cases the most important goal for the week is a good estimate with confidence that we understand everything that’s needed.

What we give to them:

1. Estimate spreadsheet (share it comment-only, and wait until after reviewing it on a call).
2. Trello board:
  1. New product: user stories with detailed Cucumber scenarios
  2. Consulting work on an existing product: technical investigation and details of tasks and recommendations
3. Capture document summarizing the above
