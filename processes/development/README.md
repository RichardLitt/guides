# OK GROW!'s development processes

## Principles

These are the overarching principles that guide the actual details of the process:

- **Quality is the most important thing. Above all else.**
- Maximizing frequent output is more important than individual efficiency.
- Work in progress should be minimized. Anything started but not 100% delivered is a scheduling risk (it's hard to know really how close to done it is), and "waste" (in the Lean sense). “100% delivered” means the client has reviewed and accepted it, it's deployed to production, and there are no small things left for later unless they’re defined as a separate card.
- We make short-term commitments to ourselves and our clients, as a team, not as individuals.
- We peer-review everything.
